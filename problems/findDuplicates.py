Find The Duplicates
Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of passport numbers, implement a function findDuplicates that returns an array of all passport numbers that are both in arr1 and arr2. Note that the output array should be sorted in an ascending order.

Let N and M be the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively. Solve for two cases and analyze the time & space complexities of your solutions: M â‰ˆ N - the array lengths are approximately the same M â‰« N - arr2 is much bigger than arr1.

Example:
input:  arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], arr2 = [3, 6, 7, 8, 20]

output: [3, 6, 7] # since only these three values are both in arr1 and arr2
